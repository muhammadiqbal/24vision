Speed & Consumption at sea
Service speeds and Fuel consumptions are in Good weather conditions ( up to Beaufort Wind Scale 4 or up to Douglas sea state 3 with significant wave height max 1.25 m), in deep water and no adverse current conditions.
Consumption for M/E + A/E - IFO 380cst RMG 380, ISO 8217:2010.
 
Laden condition:
abt. 11.00 Kts = abt 26.5 Mts/day
abt. 12.00 Kts = abt 29.4 Mts/day
Ballast condition
abt 11.00 Kts = abt 22.5 Mts/day
abt 12.00 Kts = abt 23.5 Mts/day
abt 13.00 Kts = abt 25.0 Mts/day
 
The above consumptions are based on the Engine Load (up to maximum 85%)
 
Vessel may consume MDO in Main Engine/generators for warming up of the system & Start/Stop. Vessel runs two generators for Steaming in/out of Port, shifting berth/anchorage, navigating in congested waters/inland waters/channels, during poor visibility; during load/discharging at anchorage on Barges/lighters with bad weather and /or strong currents, ballast exchanges, holds washing, and in-port running of boiler. Vessel will also consume additional 1.5mt IFO per day when using boilers in port.
 
For the purpose of this clause, the average speed and average bunker consumption shall be calculated by reference to the observed distance from pilot station to pilot station on the high seas and by reference to periods of 24 hours, from engine full away on departure to engine slow down on arrival. 
 
The average Speed and Consumption is to be assessed in good weather conditions only, which is defined as under Beaufort scale four, under Douglas sea state three, and always excluding any time during which (i) reduction of speed is necessary for safety due to navigation in congested waters or during poor visibility; (ii) any periods when vessel is ballasting/deballasting or during cleaning of cargo holds ; (iii) under influence of swell and or tidal streams and/or currents; (iv) when vessel is manoeuvring within harbour, inland waters, channels, where slow speed is required due to national/international and local regulations and all times when pilot is on board; (vi) when vessel is following/proceeding in convoy, using escorts, or following instructions of underwriters, government of Nation under whose flag the vessel sails, security council of the United Nations or other supranational body when navigating in Pirate infested areas. 
 
Fuel Consumptions at Port
One Aux. Engine without cargo operation - about 2.5 Mts IFO/day 
Two Aux. Engines (cargo operation using two Crans) - about 3.7 Mts IFO/day 
Two Aux. Engines (cargo operation using more than two Crans) - about 4.6 Mts/day
Boiler min. 1.5 Mt/day in tropical area (depend on load/demand)
Boiler min 3.0 Mt/day in the winter season (depend on load/demand)
