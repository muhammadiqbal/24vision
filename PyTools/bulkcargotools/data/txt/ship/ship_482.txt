SPEED  AND  CONSUMPTION 

 

service speed is abt 13.0 knots on calm sea and beaufort scale max 4

consuming abt 25 mtns ifo (380cst) plus 1mt if boiler used .  

 

ECO abt 12.5 in ballast /laden on abt 24 mt IFO (380 cst) plusc 1mt if boiler used

and no adverse current and no negative influence of swell .

  

idle condition in port      = about 2.10 MTS IFO / MDO OR MGO

port operating cranes       = about 3.90 MTS IFO / MDO OR MGO

when using boiler           = about 1.00 MTS IFO / MDO OR MGO 

  

....if boiler is used ,consumption is  :

the consumption of boiler is additional 1 mtn when is using to warm

ifo as well when vsl is in winter and cold weathers .

it is not a daily consumption.
